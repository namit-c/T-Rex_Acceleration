\section{Technology}
\subsection{Programming Language: }
The language Python will be used to build the project. As the project involves developing a game, the Python library Pygame will be used. Pygame is a library composed of modules that specialize in developing games. As the game will not be graphics intensive, Pygame should be sufficient to produce the intended visual quality of the game.  


\subsection{Testing Framework}

\subsection{Documentation}
All text documents for this project will be built using LaTeX. The LaTeX file and PDF will be available for each document in their corresponding folder on GitLab. 


\section{Coding Style}
Since it is a Python based project, We will follow PEP8 standard as our coding style for code consistency.
